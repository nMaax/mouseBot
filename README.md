# Amphetamine - mouse bot

This python script is going to make your mouse move automatically around a little box in the screen, the purpose of this is to make your pc always awake and make you look not AFK to other programs/websites who tries to control that.

This script is mainly invented for Windows/Linux machines since Mac already has an app called [Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/amphetamine) who does this work greatly. In any case anyone can use this script :smiley:

There are 2 version of the program:
1. Amphetamine
2. NightOWL

They all do the same job with small differences, if in doubt I suggest you to use Amphetamine :rocket:

## How to install

### Dependencies

You will need the pyautogui library and the latest python version installed on you machine

### Installation

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install the pyautogui library by running this command in a terminal 
    ```python -m pip install pyautogui```     
3. Clone this repo or the specific program you need wherever you want
4. In the terminal, move to the folder where you downloaded this repo
5. Run the program with the command
    ```python Amphetamine.py``` (or the program you prefer)

> ***Note***
   > Eventually sobstitute the _python_ keyword with the path where is python.exe installed, 
   > _e.g. (in a Windows machine) C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m pip install pyautogui_

## How to stop the script

You can always kill the script with these 3 alternatives:

  1. Moving the pointer on the **UPPER-RIGHT** corner, it will panic stop pyautogui
  2. Do ```Ctrl+Tab``` to find the console window and then ```Ctrl+C``` to close the script
  3. Spam ```Alt+F4```
