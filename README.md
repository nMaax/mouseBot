# Amphetamine: mouse bot

This python script is going to make your mouse move automatically around a little box in the screen

You can always kill the script with these 3 alternatives:

  1. Moving the pointer on the UPPER-RIGHT corner, it will panic stop pyautogui
  2. Do Ctrl+Tab to find the console window and then Ctrl+C to close the script
  3. Spam Alt+F4

## Dependencies

You will need the pyautogui library and the latest python version installed on you machine, in order to do that

  1. Install Python following this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
  2. Open the terminal and run this command in order to install the pyautogui library: 
      python -m pip install pyautogui
     
     Or eventually sobstitute the 'python' keyword with the path where is python.exe installe, 
     
     e.g. (in a Windows machine) C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m pip install pyautogui
  
  3. Save the Amphetamine.py file wherever you want and copy the path where it is installed
  
  5. Still in the terminal run the program with the command
      python <pathOfInstallation>\Amphetamine.py
